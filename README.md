# QA Interview

## Setup

This app has been hosted at: [http://qainterview.pythonanywhere.com](http://qainterview.pythonanywhere.com). Follow this setup only if you want to use a local copy of this application. 

1. `pip install requirements.txt`


## How to run the QA interview application

To start the application, run `python qa_interview.py` and visit `localhost:6464` in your browser.


## What the application does

The application calculates the factorial of a given number. We have exactly one page with:

* one text box 
* one submit button
* a page title 
* three hyperlinks 
* a copyright message

By keeping the application this simple, we are increasing the likelihood of the interviewer and the candidate agreeing upon what is important. You can also reasonably expect QA to be able to verbalize their testing for such limited functionality.
